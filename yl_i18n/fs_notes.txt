Reentrant
From Wikipedia
==============
A computer program or routine is described as reentrant if it can be safely
executed concurrently; that is, the routine can be re-entered while it is
already running. To be reentrant, a function must:

* Hold no static (global) non-constant data. 
* Must not return the address to static (global) non-constant data. 
* Must work only on the data provided to it by the caller. 
* Must not rely on locks to singleton resources. 
* Must not call non-reentrant functions. 



Driver Stack
============

Application Layer
----------------
Drive Manager --> Posix Layer
*FileX FAT --> sends file requests to FX Driver
FX Driver --> handles requests and passes to Driver Task
Driver Task	--> calls NFTL to do sector read/write ===> initialize the lower drivers and then system registers its upper driver "FX Driver" to drive manager
NFTL --> receive an MTD and produce NFTL structure
NFC Manager --> generic nand management
NAND Driver or Simulator  --> calls NAND Base to produce an MTD structure
